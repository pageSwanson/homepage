## Experience

### Full-stack Software Engineer / Abrigo - Remote
<span>09 / 2017 → Present</span>

__Develops applications for large data transfer__ alongside a team of 9 full-stack engineers and product managers to enable a pipeline with applications using C# targetting .NET Standard. __Provides hourly support__ for client-facing project managers, responding to service requirements for over a thousand financial institutions across the US. __Delivers features in an Agile framework__ on a bi-weekly sprint schedule to release tested updates on a regular cycle. __Part of a frontend initiative__ to introduce code share opportunities across teams, packaging/build process improvements, a contemporary frontend workflow, and wider internal adoption of the Vue.js framework. __Scaled a document import service__ as a way of onboarding client image repositories with existing financials. Reworked to incorporate existing NHibernate respository layer for import transactions, unit tests with Moq, task logging with line-item feedback. Added an avenue for distributing internal documents across customer libraries for rapid internal document transfer. __Engineered a guided walkthrough__ using knowledge of component architectures for AngularJS to setup a modular onboarding interface. Included widgets capable of parsing initial extracts to generate mappings, check data integrity, and poll services to suggest configuration improvements. Enabled a subscription pathway with greater agency for the financial institution. Inspired new workflows in other parts of the product inheriting this modularity. __Built a logs view__ for historical detail on imports and transfers. Revealed previously inaccessible reporting for improved client support, enabled user-led problem solving. Recent optimizations include improvements to lookup SQL performance with table normalization and scheduled data consolidation approach.

### Software Developer in Residence / NHFPL - New Haven, Ct
<span>05 / 2020 → Present</span>

__Serves as a community reference__ for software development resources and learning tools. Leads sessions on a bi-weekly basis with introductions to core web technologies as an entry point to learning code. Offers weekly individual help sessions as office hours for aid in coding of all kinds. __Leads an app building series__ teaching newcomers about the development landscape and web technologies targetting mobile devices.

### Programming Systems Teaching Assistant / Georgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, Ga
<span>09 / 2016 → 05 / 2017</span>

__Assisted sophomore programmers__ with algorithm development, data structures, and general concepts in theory and design using C and MIPS assembly languages

### Product & Test Engineering Intern / Texas Instruments - Dallas, Tx
<span>05 / 2016 → 08 / 2016</span>

__Designed an internal web portal__ to process and archive data from a test device document. Used Python for text parsing, data-driven decision making, and report creation for a team of 5 engineers. __Experimented with a JSON body__ for requests with Ajax, received using the Python Requests library. Included form sanitization in JavaScript and document content checking with regex via Python on the server-side where all inputs had an expectation. __Built responsive data visualizations__ with Plottable.js to identify trends in test device design.

### Network Intern / Technology Services Organization at Georgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, Ga
<span>10 / 2014 → 05 / 2016</span>

__Performed maintenance and patching__ on more than 40 Cisco switches for the College of Computing. Deployed hardware upgrades and assisted with expansion of compute resources for students.

## Projects

### TOVA - A Responsive Musical Synthesizer
<span>12 / 2016 → 05 / 2017</span>

__Prototyped a holistic music synthesis device__ which responded to arbitrary input audio and note sequences with a voice selection and melodic phrase. __Contributed an audio feature extraction module__ based around the chromagram with Python using librosa for input audio analysis on the Raspberry Pi. __Trained a pitched tone classifier__ with the TensorFlow learning framework using calculated points from over 4000 audio files to pair an accompanying voice from an analog synthesis module.

### Sub 1 Kbps Speech Coder
<span>03 / 2017 → 04 / 2017</span>

__Implemented a 996 bps speech coder__ in MATLAB while maintaining intelligible speech and speaker fingerprint. Constructed architecture with elements of LPC, codebook vector quantization and pulse excitation in MELP.

### Eye Tracking with Biopotentials
<span>10 / 2016 → 12 / 2016</span>

__Extended a virtual reality system__ to measure eye movements, combining the primary sensor with head tracking to translate user focus in VR. Helped with functional range to account for reading distribution across different users for improved calibration.

### Guthman-Moog Musical Instrument Competition
<span>02 of 2015, 2016, 2017</span>

__3-time participant and finalist__ in 2015 with an IR emitter PVC slide instrument and in 2016 with a light-based breath transducer to create a wind controller for the Moog Werkstatt synthesizer kit.
