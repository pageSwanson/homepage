## Experience

### Full-stack Software Engineer / Abrigo - Remote
<span>09 / 2017 → Present</span>

__Develops applications for large data transfer__ alongside a team of 9 full-stack engineers and product managers to enable a rapid import pipeline (Agile w/ Jira, C#, .NETStandard) __Provides hourly support__ for client-facing project managers, responding to service requirements for over a thousand financial institutions across the US __Part of a frontend initiative__ to introduce code sharing opportunities across teams, build process improvements and a contemporary frontend workflow (Vue.js) __Scaled a document import service__ to onboard client image repositories with existing financials. Incorporated repository layer for import transactions, unit tests, task logging with line-item feedback. Added an avenue for internal document distribution to customer portals for fast advisory feedback (NHibernate, LINQ, SQL, Moq) __Engineered a guided walkthrough__ by learning component architectures for a modular onboarding interface. Included widgets for parsing initial extracts to generate mappings, check data integrity, and poll services to suggest new configurations. Enabled a subscription pathway with greater agency for the financial institution and inspired two new product workflows (AngularJS, components)

### Software Developer in Residence / NHFPL - New Haven, Ct
<span>05 / 2020 → Present</span>

__Serves as a community reference__ for software development resources and learning tools. Leads sessions on a bi-weekly basis with introductions to core web technologies as an entry point to learning code. Offers weekly individual help sessions as office hours for aid in coding of all kinds (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) __Leads an app-building series__ teaching newcomers about the development landscape and web technologies targeting mobile devices (NativeScript)

### Programming Systems Teaching Assistant / Georgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, Ga
<span>09 / 2016 → 05 / 2017</span>

__Assisted Sophomore programmers__ with algorithm development, data structures, and general concepts in theory and design (C, MIPS Assembly)

### Product & Test Engineering Intern / Texas Instruments - Dallas, Tx
<span>05 / 2016 → 08 / 2016</span>

__Designed an internal web portal__ to process and archive data from a test device document. Used a custom text parser to support decision trees and report creation for a team of 5 engineers (Python) __Experimented with request mocking__ and included frontend form sanitization and server-side document content checking where all inputs had an expectation mapping (promises, Requests, regex) __Built responsive data visualizations__ to identify trends in test device design (Plottable.js)

<!--
### Network Intern / Technology Services Organization at Georgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, Ga
<span>10 / 2014 → 05 / 2016</span>

__Performed maintenance and patching__ on more than 40 Cisco switches for the College of Computing. Deployed hardware upgrades and assisted in expanding student compute resources
-->

## Projects

### TOVA - A Responsive Musical Synthesizer
<span>12 / 2016 → 05 / 2017</span>

__Prototyped a holistic music synthesis device__ which responded to arbitrary input audio and note sequences with a voice selection and melodic phrase __Contributed an audio feature extraction module__ based around the chromagram for input audio analysis (raspPi, Python, librosa) __Trained a pitched tone classifier__ using calculated points from over 4000 audio files to pair an accompanying voice from an analog synthesis module (TensorFlow)

### Sub 1 Kbps Speech Coder
<span>03 / 2017 → 04 / 2017</span>

__Implemented a 996 bps speech coder__ while maintaining intelligible speech and speaker fingerprint. Constructed architecture with elements of LPC, codebook vector quantization and pulse excitation in MELP (MATLAB)

<!--
### Eye Tracking with Biopotentials
<span>10 / 2016 → 12 / 2016</span>

__Extended a virtual reality system__ to measure eye movements, combining the primary sensor with head tracking to translate user focus in VR. Helped with functional range to account for reading distribution across different users for improved calibration (Processing, Arduino)
-->

### Guthman-Moog Musical Instrument Competition
<span>2015, 2016, 2017</span>

__3-time participant and finalist__ in 2015 with an IR emitter PVC slide instrument and in 2016 with a light-based breath transducer to create a wind controller for the Moog Werkstatt synthesizer kit
