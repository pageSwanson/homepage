Professional programmer with experience in production software for a .NET ecosystem with C#, MS-Sql, and ES5/ES6. As of today: teaching coding locally, renewing personal interest in C through independent work, freelancing with ES6 using a functional approach, and learning Rust via a sequencer clone project. Native English speaker learning German (basic competency).

## Education

### Georgia Institute of Technology
<span>05 / 2017</span>

- __B.S. Computer Engineering__, GPA : 3.5 / 4.0, ECE Opportunity Research Scholar

## Experience

### Software Developer in Residence / NHFPL - New Haven, Ct
<span>05 / 2020 → Present</span>

- __Serves as a community reference__ for learning programming at the library. Sessions on a bi-weekly basis emphasizing core web technologies as an entry point to coding. Holds weekly office hours for help with programming of all kinds (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- __Introduced concepts in audio software__ through graphical programming, creating instruments for performance, composition, and sound processing (PureData)
- __Lead a database survey series__ where participants followed tutorials on query building, understanding schema, and finally building and running a micro database server (SQLite, deno)
<!--
- __Lead an app-building series__ teaching newcomers about the development landscape and web technologies targeting mobile devices (NativeScript)
-->

### Full-stack Software Engineer / Abrigo - Remote
<span>09 / 2017 → 11/2021</span>

- __Developed applications for large data transfer__ alongside a team of 10 engineers, product managers, and QA to enable a rapid and stable financial import pathway (Agile w/ Jira, C#, .NETStandard)
- __Provided hourly support__ for client-facing project managers, responding to service requirements for over one thousand financial institutions across the US, with extensive assistance during the 2020 national SBA disbursement period for institutions providing loans at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding in the pipeline for subscribers to service more than 1 million in funds
- __Participated in a frontend initiative__ to introduce resource sharing across teams, build process improvements, and a contemporary frontend workflow (Vue.js)
- __Scaled a document import service__ to onboard client image repositories with existing financials. Incorporated entity layer for import transactions, unit tests, task logging with line-item feedback. Added an avenue for internal document distribution to customer portals for fast advisory feedback (NHibernate, LINQ, SQL, Moq)
- __Engineered a guided walkthrough__ by learning component architectures for a modular onboarding interface. Included widgets for parsing initial extracts to generate mappings, check data integrity, and poll services to suggest new configurations. Enabled a subscription pathway with greater agency for the financial institution and inspired a series of similar initiatives (AngularJS, components)

### Programming Systems Teaching Assistant / Georgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, Ga
<span>09 / 2016 → 05 / 2017</span>

- __Assisted Sophomore programmers__ with algorithm development, data structures, and general concepts in theory and design (C, MIPS Assembly)

### Product & Test Engineering Intern / Texas Instruments - Dallas, Tx
<span>05 / 2016 → 08 / 2016</span>

- __Designed an internal web portal__ to process and archive data from a test device document. Built a text parser to support decision trees and report creation for a team of 5 engineers (Python)
- __Experimented with request mocking__ and included form sanitization and server-side input type expectations (Promise, Requests, regex)

<!--
### Network Intern / Technology Services Organization at Georgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, Ga
<span>10 / 2014 → 05 / 2016</span>

- __Performed maintenance and patching__ on more than 40 Cisco switches for the College of Computing. Deployed hardware upgrades and assisted in expanding student compute resources
-->

## Projects

### Enmossed.org Static Website
<span>04 / 2021 → 06 / 2021</span>

- __Collaborated to create a new home__ for the Enmossed recording label. Working from a design draft, collaborated to produce a site for resources to discover the recordings produced by the label and information on releases. Using a JSON schema, the site maintainer modifies a single static document consumed by a series of components implemented as functional groups. Explored media query techniques to create a consistent experience across screens, mobile or otherwise (ES6, lit-html, Web Components)

### TOVA - A Responsive Musical Synthesizer
<span>12 / 2016 → 05 / 2017</span>

- __Prototyped a holistic music synthesis device__ which responded to audio and notes with a voice selection and melodic phrase. Contributed an audio feature pipeline based on the chromatic spectrum for input analysis (Python, librosa, TensorFlow)

### Sub 1 Kbps Speech Coder
<span>03 / 2017 → 04 / 2017</span>

- __Implemented a 996 bps speech coder__ while maintaining intelligible speech and speaker fingerprint. Constructed architecture with elements of LPC, codebook vector quantization and pulse excitation in MELP (MATLAB)

<!--
### Eye Tracking with Biopotentials
<span>10 / 2016 → 12 / 2016</span>

- __Extended a virtual reality system__ to measure eye movements, combining the primary sensor with head tracking to translate user focus in VR. Helped with functional range to account for reading distribution across different users for improved calibration (Processing, Arduino)
-->

### Guthman-Moog Musical Instrument Competition
<span>2015, 2016, 2017</span>

- __3-time participant and finalist__ in 2015 with an IR emitter PVC slide instrument and in 2016 with a light-based breath transducer to create a wind controller for the Moog Werkstatt synthesizer
