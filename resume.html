<h3>Software Developer in Residence / New Haven Free Public Library -
New Haven, CT</h3>
<p><span>05 / 2020 → Present</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serves as a community reference</strong> for learning
programming at the library. Hosting bi-weekly sessions emphasizing core
web technologies as an entry point to coding with 200 participants since
initial series. Holds office hours for help with programming projects
(JavaScript, HTML, CSS)</li>
<li><strong>Introduced concepts in audio software</strong> through
graphical programming, creating instruments for sound synthesis
(PureData)</li>
<li><strong>Led a database survey series</strong> where students
followed tutorials on query building, understanding schema, and finally
building and running a micro database server (SQLite, Deno)</li>

class="level3">
<h3>Full-stack Software Engineer / Abrigo (Sageworks) - Remote</h3>
<p><span>09 / 2017 → 11/2021</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developed applications for large data transfer</strong>
alongside a team of 10 engineers, product managers, and QA to enable a
rapid and stable financial import pathway (Agile w/ Jira, C#,
.NETStandard)</li>
<li><strong>Provided hourly support</strong> for client-facing project
managers, responding to service requirements for over 1000 financial
institutions across the US, with extensive assistance during the 2020
national SBA disbursement period for institutions providing loans at the
outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding in the pipeline for subscribers
to service more than 1 million in funds.</li>
<li><strong>Part of a frontend developer initiative</strong> encouraging
resource sharing across teams, build process and workflow improvements
(Vue.js)</li>
<li><strong>Engineered a data migration frontend</strong> for managers
to quickly move configurations, relationships, and financial entities
across accounts, with feedback and severity logs to save time on common
merge operations. Iterated the backend with 2 engineers to handle
arbitrary entities using a factory pattern, resolving foreign key
dependencies in schema with entity maps in code (C#, NHibernate, LINQ,
SQL)</li>
<li><strong>Scaled a document import service</strong> to onboard client
image repositories and associate existing financials. Incorporated
entity layer for import transactions and added unit tests, task logging
with line-item feedback. Included an avenue for internal distribution to
customers for faster advisory feedback. Reduced processing times from 24
hour benchmarks to 2 hour run times with comparable loads (C#, SQL,
Moq)</li>
<li><strong>Engineered a guided walkthrough</strong> using component
architectures for a modular onboarding interface. Included automations
for parsing initial extracts to generate mappings, check data integrity,
and poll services to suggest new configurations. Over 70% of newly
serviced clients began using the walkthrough on release, relieving
effort for project managers during setup. Enabled an automated pathway
with greater agency for the financial institution and inspired a series
of similar developer initiatives (AngularJS, components)</li>
