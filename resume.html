<section id="full-stack-software-engineer--abrigo---remote" class="level3">
<h3>Full-stack Software Engineer / Abrigo - Remote</h3>
<p><span>09 / 2017 → Present</span></p>
<p><strong>Develops applications for large data transfer</strong> alongside a team of 9 full-stack engineers and product managers to enable a pipeline with applications using C# targetting .NET Standard. <strong>Provides hourly support</strong> for client-facing project managers, responding to service requirements for over a thousand financial institutions across the US. <strong>Delivers features in an Agile framework</strong> on a bi-weekly sprint schedule to release tested updates on a regular cycle. <strong>Part of a frontend initiative</strong> to introduce code share opportunities across teams, packaging/build process improvements, a contemporary frontend workflow, and wider internal adoption of the Vue.js framework. <strong>Scaled a document import service</strong> as a way of onboarding client image repositories with existing financials. Reworked to incorporate existing NHibernate respository layer for import transactions, unit tests with Moq, task logging with line-item feedback. Added an avenue for distributing internal documents across customer libraries for rapid internal document transfer. <strong>Engineered a guided walkthrough</strong> using knowledge of component architectures for AngularJS to setup a modular onboarding interface. Included widgets capable of parsing initial extracts to generate mappings, check data integrity, and poll services to suggest configuration improvements. Enabled a subscription pathway with greater agency for the financial institution. Inspired new workflows in other parts of the product inheriting this modularity. <strong>Built a logs view</strong> for historical detail on imports and transfers. Revealed previously inaccessible reporting for improved client support, enabled user-led problem solving. Recent optimizations include improvements to lookup SQL performance with table normalization and scheduled data consolidation approach.</p>
